Geometric Rules Inversion ALgorithm (GRIAL)

Quick Start Guide

SUMMARY ==============================================

GRIAL is a software for predicting inversions and refining their 
breakpoints based on the computation of some geometric rules specific 
to inversions in a PEM assay. GRIAL can also score all the predicted 
inversions based on the number of concordant PEMs in the region of the 
inversion, and the expected number of discordant PEMs supporting each 
breakpoint given the inversion size, the repetitive nature of the sequence 
of the breakpoints, and the sequencing coverage.

If you use GRIAL in your research, please cite: Martínez-Fundichely 
et al. (in preparation)


INSTALL GRIAL ========================================

1. Install all the requirements listed in the MANUAL

2. Download and extract the GRIAL software somewhere in your computer


TEST GRIAL WITH SUPPLIED SAMPLE DATA =================

The sample data supplied with GRIAL will allow you to predict inversions in the human genome based
on the discordant and concordant PEMs of fosmids obtained from these 9 individuals and mapped to 
the HG18 reference genome by Kidd et al. 2008.

1. Download and extract the sample data supplied with GRIAL in the directory ./testing/input 
	(relative to the directory where you extracted the GRIAL software)

2. Execute the command: (in the directory where you extracted the GRIAL software)
	perl ./GRIAL.pl 

3. Find your results in the directory ./testing/output
	

USE GRIAL WITH YOUR OWN DATA =========================

Using your own data you can predict inversions in any genome given a set of discordant PEMs (and 
a set of concordant PEMs if desired) obtained by any paired-end sequencing technology and mapped to
any reference genome.

1. Place your input data anywhere in your computer and create a directory for the output

2. Edit the Configuration File <GRIAL.config> as needed, at least for the sections "SECTION 1: 
	PATHS & FILENAMES" and "SECTION 2: LIBRARY STATISTICS & ASSEMBLY"
	
3. Execute the command: (in the directory where you extracted the GRIAL software)
	perl ./GRIAL.pl <Configuration_File_Name>
	
4. Find your results in the output directory
