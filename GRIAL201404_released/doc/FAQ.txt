Geometric Rules Inversion ALgorithm (GRIAL)

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

SUMMARY ==============================================

GRIAL is a software for predicting inversions and refining their 
breakpoints based on the computation of some geometric rules specific 
to inversions in a PEM assay. GRIAL can also score all the predicted 
inversions based on the number of concordant PEMs in the region of the 
inversion, and the expected number of discordant PEMs supporting each 
breakpoint given the inversion size, the repetitive nature of the sequence 
of the breakpoints, and the sequencing coverage.

If you use GRIAL in your research, please cite: Martínez-Fundichely 
et al. (in preparation)


FAQS =================================================

(*) What does GRIAL do?

GRIAL is an algorithm for predicting inversions from paired-end mapping (PEM) data.
It is based on some geometrical rules that are specific to inversions. GRIAL also
refines the breakpoints location to the shortest possible region given the uncertainty
inherent to the data. For more information on GRIAL please refer to the MANUAL and
the GRIAL publication: Martínez-Fundichely et al. (in preparation).


(*) What do we mean by "breakpoints" in the results of GRIAL?

GRIAL clusters together all PEMs that can be supporting the same inversion breakpoint
according to the set of geometrical rules described in the MANUAL and GRIAL publication.
According to the mapping position of these PEMs in the reference genome, GRIAL predicts and
refines the location of the inversion breakpoints.

Sometimes several discordant PEMs might be compatible with multiple possible inversions.
In this case, GRIAL clusters the PEMs such that they predict the minimum number of
inversions with the highest PEM support.

Also in some cases a predicted inversion is supported by discordant PEMs in only one 
breakpoint. In this case GRIAL inferes the location of the other breakpoint by applying
some geometrical rules compatible with the inversion prediction, but in this case the 
location of this inferred breakpoint is not refined.

For more information and illustration of this, please refer to the MANUAL and the GRIAL
publication: Martínez-Fundichely et al. (in preparation).


(*) Can GRIAL be used to predict other types of structural variants?

NO. The geometrical rules implemented in GRIAL are specific to the prediction of inversions
from PEM data. However, the theoretical framework developed and implemented in GRIAL might
be extended to other structural variants. See Escaramís et al. 2013. 


(*) Why running GRIAL on my PEM data is taking so much time?

The running time of GRIAL not only depends on the total number of PEMs being analyzed, but 
also on the density of PEMs in specific regions of the genome. Quite often, highly complex
regions of the genome (specially centromeres and satellite regions) contain errors or gaps
in the reference assembly. These regions tend to have a high density of discordant PEMs 
that are mostly unreliable. To reduce the running time of GRIAL we suggest avoiding these
artifactual regions by filtering PEMs mapping into satellite regions, low-complex regions or 
simple-repeats (DISCARD_MAPPINGS_IN_REPEATS=yes, DISCARD_REPEATS_LIST=EIX).

The use of concordant PEMs either to compute the statistics of the library prior to the
inversion prediction, or to score the predicted inversions, also increments the running
time of GRIAL several-fold. If your PEM data is huge, we suggest avoiding the use of
concordant PEM data by providing the library statistics (CONCORDANTS=0 and metrics provided
in the section "SECTION 2: LIBRARY STATISTICS & ASSEMBLY" of the Configuration File) and 
not scoring the predicted inversions (SCORE_INVERSIONS=no).
