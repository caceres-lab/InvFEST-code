Geometric Rules Inversion ALgorithm (GRIAL)

Release Notes

Version 1.0 ===============================================

* Preprocessig step:
Given a set of discordant PEMs for inversions, GRIAL preprocesses the data to remove duplicated PEMs, 
PEMs with overlapping ends, or PEMs mapping to repeats. (See MANUAL.)

* Histogram clustering:
GRIAL implements this clustering method to determine clusters of PEMs supporting the same inversion
breakpoint. (See MANUAL)

* Inversion definition and Breakpoint narrowing:
GRIAL defines predictions of inversions based on one or two clusters of PEMs supporting one or the two
breakpoints, respectively, and narrow the breakpoints location based on these clusters. (See MANUAL)

* Scoring:
GRIAL scores all the predicted inversions based on the number of concordant PEMs in the region of the 
inversion, and the expected number of discordant PEMs supporting each breakpoint given the inversion 
size, the repetitive nature of the sequence of the breakpoints, and sequencing coverage. (See MANUAL)
