  FIELD SPECIFICATIONS
-------------------------------------	

 Those marked with a * are mandatory:	
	
      > GENERAL INFORMATION

	Validation ID *		ID necessary to identify the corresponding genotyped individuals. It can be repeated if individuals are shared between different validations.
	Inversion name *	HsInvNNNN format. 
	Study Name *	 	Make sure that the studies in your table already exist and are written exactly the same way as they appear in the database. 
	Method *		Make sure that the methods in your table already exist and are written exactly the same way as they appear in the database.
	Status *		Make sure that the status in your table already exist and are written exactly the same way as they appear in the database.
	Force status *		Either yes or not, it will stablish automatically the new status until another status is forced.
	Comments

      > FREQUENCY WITHOUT GENOTYPES --> These values are not mandatory but if specified, all of them must be present.

	Population		Make sure that the populations in your table already exist and are written exactly the same way as they appear in the database.
	Analyzed individuals	A natural number.
	Analyzed individuals	A natural number.
	Inverted alleles	A natural number.
	Standard frequency	Standard alleles/Total alleles.
	Inverted frequency	Inverted alleles/Total alleles.
