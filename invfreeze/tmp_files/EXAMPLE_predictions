 In the case of a correct data input, all the predictions in the table will be added to InvFEST database. 

 REQUIRED FORMAT
-------------------------------------	

	Prediction ID:Chromosome:Breakpoint 1 start:Breakpoint 1 end:Breakpoint 1 between start-end:Breakpoint 2 start:Breakpoint 2 end:Breakpoint 2 between start-end:Study Name:Prediction name
	
Real example:

	1:chr10:127180574:127180574:FALSE:127187215:127187215:FALSE:INVFEST curation:CINV_delly_INV00003655

  FIELD SPECIFICATIONS
-------------------------------------	

 Those marked with a * are mandatory:


	Prediction ID *		ID necessary to identify the corresponding individuals. It can be repeated if individuals are shared between different predictions.
	Chromosome * 		 		In format chrN (being 'N' a number, Y, X or MT). 	
	Breakpoint 1 start *  			A natural number corresponding to a position in the sequence.	
	Breakpoint 1 end *  			A natural number corresponding to a position in the sequence.	
	Breakpoint 1 between start-end * 	TRUE or FALSE. TRUE means taht the real breakpoint is located between the two provided coordinates.	
	Breakpoint 2 start * 			A natural number corresponding to a position in the sequence.
	Breakpoint 2 end * 			A natural number corresponding to a position in the sequence.
	Breakpoint 2 between start-end * 	TRUE or FALSE. TRUE means that the real breakpoint is located between the two provided coordinates.
	Study Name * 				Make sure that the studies in your table already exist and are written exactly the same way as they appear in the database. 
	Prediction name 			The name or ID of the inversion in the original article.
